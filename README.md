# owasp-web-security-best-practices
A curated guide to OWASP web security best practices, including secure coding, authentication, data protection, and vulnerability prevention strategies to help developers build secure web applications.

# OWASP Web Security Best Practices

## 1. Validate Input & Sanitize Output
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server.
- Use allow-lists for validation.
- Sanitize outputs depending on context (HTML, JavaScript, SQL, etc.).

## 2. Use Strong Authentication and Session Management
- Enforce strong password policies.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Use secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite cookies.
- Auto-expire sessions after inactivity.

## 3. Use HTTPS Everywhere
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- Use HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security) headers.
- Keep TLS versions and ciphers updated.

## 4. Protect Against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Use anti-CSRF tokens.
- Validate `Origin` and `Referer` headers where applicable.

## 5. Prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Escape dynamic content before rendering.
- Use frameworks with built-in XSS protection (e.g., React).
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## 6. Use Secure Headers
Set the following HTTP headers:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Strict-Transport-Security`
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `Referrer-Policy`

## 7. Implement Proper Access Controls
- Enforce authorization on every server-side request.
- Avoid client-side logic for access control.
- Prevent predictable resource access (e.g., ID enumeration).

## 8. Secure Data at Rest and in Transit
- Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive stored data.
- Hash passwords using bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher for transmitting data.

## 9. Handle Errors Gracefully
- Do not expose stack traces or internal errors to users.
- Log errors securely and monitor for patterns.

## 10. Keep Software and Dependencies Up-to-Date
- Regularly patch all systems and libraries.
- Use OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk for known vulnerabilities.

## 11. Log and Monitor Security Events
- Log authentication attempts and abnormal behaviors.
- Use SIEM tools or monitoring services.

## 12. Avoid Security Misconfigurations
- Disable directory listing and unnecessary services.
- Remove default accounts and change default credentials.
- Audit server and file permissions.
